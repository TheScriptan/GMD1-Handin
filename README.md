# GMD1-Handin

Simple game prototype inspired by an "old" game from 2013 named Dethroned. 

# Youtube video
  Note: Gameplay was recorded on exported Windows version of the game and for some reason game behaves slightly differently that in Unity Editor.

# Controls

  - RMB to move
  - RMB to attack (when clicked on enemy Hero or Minion)
  - X to build barracks
  - X to recruit minion
  
# Game Idea
  To win, you need to reach 100 score. It can be done two ways: creating minions that attack enemy TownHall and increase your score or control pillars on the hills.

# Gameplay

  - Capture Gold Mines to accumulate gold for Minions
  - Capture Pillars on the hills to accumulate score
  - Fight enemy hero to stop his progress
  - Don't allow enemy minions to get near your Town Hall as it will be attacked and increase score of Blue team!
  

 # Future Development

  - Fix millions of bugs
  - Visual indication of capturing Gold Mines
  - Well that restores Hero health when interacted with
  - Gold chest spawned in the middle
  - Boss spawned in the middle
  - Structure the code (Never ending process...)
  - Main Menu
  - Death Animations
  - More states for AI
  - Melee & Ranged attacks
  - Tower building
